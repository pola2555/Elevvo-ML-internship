# Elevvo-ML-internship


Thanks, Pola. Based on the `tasks.rar` archive and the **Machine Learning Tasks.pdf**, Iâ€™ll prepare a professional `README.md` you can put on GitHub to present the first 4 tasks you've completed. It will include:

* Project structure
* Description of each task
* Key concepts and tools
* How to run the code
* Summary of results

## ðŸ§© Task Descriptions

### ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Student Score Prediction
- **Goal:** Predict students' final scores based on study hours and other factors.
- **Data:** Student Performance dataset (Kaggle).
- **Process:** Cleaned data, visualized trends, split into train/test, trained linear regression.
- **Output:** Plotted predictions, evaluated with MAE, RMSE.

### ðŸ“˜ Task 2: Customer Segmentation
- **Goal:** Segment mall customers by spending habits.
- **Data:** Mall Customer dataset (Kaggle).
- **Process:** Applied feature scaling, performed K-Means clustering, used Elbow and Silhouette methods.
- **Output:** Cluster visualizations and business insight from segmentation.

### ðŸ“˜ Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification
- **Goal:** Classify forest cover type using environmental features.
- **Data:** UCI Covertype dataset.
- **Models Used:** Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning), XGBoost.
- **Extras:** Evaluated with classification report, confusion matrix, feature importance plots.
- **Key Concepts:** Multi-class classification, model comparison, optimization.

### ðŸ“˜ Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction
- **Goal:** Predict whether a loan will be approved.
- **Data:** Loan Approval Prediction dataset (Kaggle).
- **Steps:** Cleaned and encoded categorical data, used SMOTE for class imbalance.
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.
- **Evaluation:** Focused on Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
